## Casts
Displays casted skills and their durations and hit counts.
Duration is colored based on the animation as categorized by ArcDPS (full aftercast, cancelled aftercast, interrupt).
Hit count is colored based on the expected and maximum amount of hits.

You can supply custom skill definitions via `arcdps_buddy_skills.yml`.
The plugin ships with the default definitions in [src/data/skills](./src/data/skills/).
A single entry for a skill looks like this:

```yml
- id: 12345 # id of casted skill.
  hit_ids: [23456, 34567] # optional: additional skill ids to count for hits.
  hits: 5 # optional: number of hits. enables hit tracking. set to 0 to track with unknown hits.
  expected: 4 # optional: number of expected hits. threshold for yellow color. defaults to >= half hits.
  max_duration: 10000 # optional: maximum duration (ms). hits after the duration + error margin count towards a new cast.
  minion: true # optional: whether to include hits from own minions.
```

Individual default skill definitions can be overwritten or disabled:

```yml
- id: 12345 # overwrite the default entry entirely
  hits: 5
- id: 12345 # disable the default entry
  enabled: false
```
